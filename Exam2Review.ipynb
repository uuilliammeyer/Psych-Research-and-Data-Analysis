    "\n",
    "***Statistical Power:*** is the probability that the study will give a significant result *if the research hypothesis is true*.\n",
    "    - A lot of times we use statistical power to determine sample size.\n",
    "    - The probablility of getting a significant result if the research hypothesis is false is alpha.\n",
    "- Statistical power is determined by 2 main factors:\n",
    "    1. Effect size the research hypothesis predicts\n",
    "        - If your question is how can effect size impact power, first remember the formula $ d = \\frac{M_{1}-M_{2}}{\\sigma} $ \n",
    "        - The larger the expected **difference between the previous research and what you predict**, the larger the power levels. This can be interpreted as changing the numerator or a change in $ M_{1}-M_{2} $\n",
    "        - By the same resasoning a smaller **population standard deviation**, the larger the effect size and thus more power. This is a change in $ \\sigma $\n",
    "    2. Sample size\n",
    "        - The more people there are in a study the greater the power. Sample size effects power because the larger the sample size is, the smaller the standard deviation of the distribution of means becomes. This causes less overlpa between our null hypothesis curve and our research hypothesis curve.\n",
    "- Other factors include:\n",
    "    - One vs two tailed hypothesis testing\n",
    "        - Two tailed tests are harfer to get significant results with.\n",
    "    - Alpha or siginificance level\n",
    "        - More lenient significance levels like p<0.1 yield more power. However, thisn increase the chance of a type II error.\n",
    "    - The kind of testing procedure\n",
    "        - You probably won't be asked about this but just know that some kinds of experiments are more likely to yield significant results than others."
